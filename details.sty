  "content": "Successful Marketing Strategies May Have Made Stan Culture Worse, But There Is Still Time To Fix It\n\nLet's discover how fan culture became so extreme and some ways marketing can also be used to solve the problem\n\nMost of us are fans of some artists. It could be an artist from your childhood, an artist you got into recently, or one your parents introduced to you. The love for this artist is tempered and is sometimes driven by a memory from the past or an aspect of a song that you find intriguing.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes appreciation for an artist can turn obsessive and can dip into what we call stan culture. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, stans are \"extremely or excessively enthusiastic and devoted fans.\" In recent years, standom has gone from a derogatory term to a badge of honor. We saw this most recently in the catastrophic Megan the Stallion and Nicki Minaj beef which went from both rappers trading insults over music to stans of both musicians sending threats and doxing one another.\n\nIn this piece, I make the argument that several successful marketing strategies inadvertently empowered stans and gave them the heightened ability to act out their worse behaviors. This piece is for anybody who's a music fan and wants to learn more about stan culture and for stans who wish to learn how to break out of the toxic cycle.\n\nI organized the piece into the following sections:\n\nMarketing Stages: In this section, I summarize three chronological periods in stan culture and describe how they influenced the growth of the stan community. Within these descriptions, I highlight the marketing strategy used to facilitate the cultural growth of standom.\n\nRecommendations: In this section, I provide five alternative marketing strategies for fans, record labels, and social media platforms to promote healthier and safer fan communities.\n\nStan Culture Doesn't Define The Fans: I summarize the piece with final thoughts and anecdotes from the above recommendations.\n\nMarketing Stages\n\nMarketing Stage #1: The Virality Of A Song (1990s - 2000s)\n\nSummary Of Era\n\nSometimes, the virality of a song is a bellwether for an emerging cultural trend. When Eminem's 2000 hit single \"Stan\" first came out, the song was seen as an apparent warning song for obsessive fans who had the potential to become violent. At the time, the average music fan saw these obsessive fans sporadically and recognized how dangerous they were.\n\nFor instance, a few years before \"Stan\" came out, in 1993, Bjork's super fan-turned-killer tried to send the Icelandic star a package of a deadly bomb in the mail so that when he committed suicide the same day, they would be united in the afterlife. Harrowing stories like this were what was in the zeitgeist at the time when people talked about stans and the dark corners of fan culture.\n\nMarketing Strategy Used\n\nIn this era, virality was the marketing strategy used that accidentally spotlighted the power and ability of stans. These wild stories and top headline descriptions of extreme fans' actions to see and meet their favorite artists influenced potential stans to try the same.\n\nMarketing Stage #2: Quick And Easy Community Building (2010s)\n\nSummary Of Era\n\nThe internet put fans on an unpredictable path towards standom. Not only were fans now more capable of connecting, but they were also feeding their worse instincts simultaneously. Online communities on sites like Reddit and Twitter were incubators for fans to talk with stans and become further radicalized.\n\nTherefore, when watershed moments happened like the infamous 2015 Drake and Meek Mill beef, the stans of both artists sprung into action. During the heated dispute, stans on Twitter mobilized their internet skills and posted memes in connection with Drake's track \"Back To Back\" and disputed with each other about who was the better, more authentic MC.\n\nThe internet chatter got so loud that Drake performed on a stage with a screen of anti-Meek Mill memes during his OVO Fest Festival performance that year. From then on, rap beef was no longer something relegated to the involved artists, but it was a much broader-scoped conflict that stans can and will take part in.\n\nUnfortunately, the internet didn't just make stan culture harmless and funny memes. Through social media challenges, trends, and hashtags, stans can also insert themselves into artists' lives in dangerous ways. For example, in 2023, fans would throw whatever objects they had on hand at their favorite artist while the artists were performing. Fans recorded the incident to keep the trend going, encouraging more people to join. These violent incidents included the most significant names in the industry, including Taylor Swift and Harry Styles, and even led to some injuries.\n\nMarketing Strategy Used\n\nThe internet fostered community and engagement with people who would otherwise never meet. Therefore, the easy-to-use and convenient communication tools embedded in the internet, such as chat systems and blog pages, allowed extreme fans to work together and maximize their ideas, no matter how delusional.\n\nMarketing Stage #3: Labels Lend Their Support (2020s)\n\nSummary Of Era\n\nAs social media platforms expanded and fans started getting louder voices, record labels and artists reacted by establishing the direct-to-fan business strategy. For example, record labels over the last few years have used marketing budgets to promote their artists on TikTok, encouraging fans to interact with the songs during challenges. This strategy is what helped RAYE's \"Escapism\" grow so fast and unexpectedly. The goal of the business strategy's is simple: Create as few barriers as possible between the artist and their fans. This marketing strategy allowed artists to communicate directly with fans, pooling ideas in real time to help spread the message of a song, or get an artist's perspective across more effectively.\n\nYou can probably predict where stans took this well intentioned strategy.\n\nSoon, stans hijacked these opportunities to threaten, blackmail, and bully their favorite artists to do their bitting. In other cases, artists inappropriately galvanized their stans through this model to dox and harm other artists they disliked.\n\nMarketing Strategy Used\n\nThe direct-to-consumer marketing strategy is used a lot during the present era. This model makes it increasingly difficult to decipher between the artist intentions and their fans actions. In the past, the lines weren't so blurry. In the song \"Stan,\" for instance, when the obsessive fan was acting out, we knew Eminem had nothing to do with it because the quickest way they could communicate was through letters sent back and forth through the mail.\n\nNowadays, fans are talking with artists like they're friends on their TikTok live streams, in direct messages, in the private chatrooms and even in-person. Thanks to the direct reach artists have to fans now, when stans act out, it's not always obvious the stans are doing acting independently.\n\nRecommendations For The Future\n\nJournalists will write about stan culture sometimes like it's too big of a problem to solve or an infection that we caught too late, and is now fatal. I am not one of those pessimists. In fact, I think we're at the perfect moment to use the internet tools that we have, the social media communities that are present, and the platform's current community standards to present recommendations for a safer, more friendly fan culture.\n\nBelow are my five recommendations:\n\n1) For Social Media Platforms: Spotlight The Behavior You Want To See Through Your Community Guidelines\n\nThis recommendation is specifically for social media platforms. Their communities guidelines surrounding hate speech need to be acted upon when stan groups get out of hand. There are several guidelines like the example I list below that articulates the exact type of boundary that would prevent some of the worst offenses made by stan groups. The goal is to create a sanctuary for healthy discussion and to appropriately reprimand bad behavior if someone breaks the guidelines.\n\nTo improve our current stan culture situation, social platforms need to have a tested and fair response to handle negative behavior in a professional way. If necessary, these platforms should hire mediators or conflict resolution experts to address online problems in social media community spaces when they arise.\n\nExample: The fan-centric nonprofit Fandom Forward has one of the most inspiring and forward-thinking community guidelines in the last ten years. In it, the organization uplifts the communal values of the group and the individual self-esteem (see commitment 10) of each fan who decides to become a member of the nonprofit. Therefore, Fandom Forward is setting itself up for success by reaffirming the group's expected good behavior through the healthy and psychologically stable individual lives of each member.\n\n2) For Fans: Focus On Building Positive Community Strategies Over Parasocial Relationships With the Artist\n\nFor this recommendation, I am speaking to the fans. It's easier than ever to fall into parasocial traps set by celebrities and influencers online. The streaming community is essentially incentivizing viewers to engage and respond to their favorite streamers this way. Unfortunately, that behavior has seeped profoundly into the music community, and we see obsessed fans with nearly every mainstream artist, as well as the independent ones.\n\nTherefore, it's up to the fans to build positive community spaces for themselves. They can focus on the music when they speak together as a fan community instead of the artist's personal life. Whether these fan meetings are in person or virtual these new kinds of fan community members need to elevate each other. Their strength lies in their ability to prioritize the important things and give less attention to the fans who want to stir in the drama.\n\nExample: On Meet Up, the social pairing platform, classic music fans around the world have city-centric clubs for which they can sign up. In the groups, fans can watch shows at unique locations around their city and meet other fans of the timeless genre. These meet-ups put the music first and do a great job at fostering personal relationships between fans in a safe, agreed-upon way that nurtures in-person communication skills. Each group has thousands of members, and regular events throughout the year. Through these meetings, Meet Up helps build a music family deeply rooted in people's love for the genre.\n\n3) For Streaming Companies: Use Fans Love To Amplify Fundraising Initiatives Started By The Artist\n\nFans could continue gathering and supporting the artists they love with the tools available to them in today's age. What would benefit fandoms the most is if streaming companies utilized fans' enormous groups to add additional fuel and media attention to important issues the artist is addressing. These could be online fundraising like GoFundMe or in-person ones at car washes or food drives. If these fundraising drives are piggybacking off the fame of an artist, then they have a greater likelihood of being supported by non-fans in the community who know what the issue is due to the name recognition of the star pushing the issue.\n\nExample: Spotify integrated the Fan Support tool into artists' profiles to supplement their income during COVID-19. Years later, over 200,000 artists still use the tool on the platform. Fans could either directly support an artist monetarily or support a cause near and dear to the artist. More streaming platforms must incorporate a similar model, especially the bigger ones like Amazon Music and Apple Music, for fans to feel attached to their favorite artist in a healthy and socially responsible way.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\n4) For Social Media Platforms: Uplift The Brand Identity Of Online Fan Communities Through Regular Meet-ups About The Music, Not The Artist.\n\nSocial media platforms should encourage fans to unite their shared love of an artist to build community and expand the artist's brand on their platform. They can accomplish this by creating the space for fans to organize regular meet-ups, compete in contests set up by the artist, and even start communications directly with the artist. These tools exist on almost all major social media platforms, so it's hard to believe how few artists use them. These brand-based communities can help foster healthy interactions between fans and hold them accountable to an artist who can and should connect directly with them.\n\nExample: No company does a better job uniting fans into a warm and empowering community than With The Band. Through their Fan Crews groups, fans can join and connect on various levels. The two standout features include working together on fan projects (coming up with hashtags, organizing signs for a concert) and fan meet-ups (meeting to watch a music film, gathering at a radio station that the artist is showing up at, etc.).\n\nNot only are fans creating these cool and meaningful projects, but they are in direct communication with the artists themselves. Although more artists need to sign up for the platform, With The Band's business model is something other companies should replicate. With The Band fosters safe and enriching communities that allow artists to reap a deserved monetary reward for their transparency and the fans to engage appropriately with the artist.\n\n5) For Record Labels: The Label Should Reward Positive Fan Bases With Exclusive Content and Opportunities For Their Healthy Behavior\n\nRecord labels must handle the logistics once an artist declares a fan contest. Further, exclusive content, special discounts, early screenings, and meet and greets should be some of the known prizes before a competition begins to rile up engagement and excitement around a particular competition. Therefore, record labels have a colossal responsibility to build these relationships with social media platforms to organize a clear communication channel for fans. Hence, they're familiar with the rules and deadlines for the competition.\n\nExample: The record labels are already considering rolling out this kind of plan through their superfan initiatives. For example, working with tech companies, Universal Music CEO Sir Lucian Grainge described earlier this year how he plans to provide direct communication for fans to speak directly to artists and for dedicated fans, or \"superfans,\" to get unique products as a reward for their engagement.\n\nWhile platforms already do this, such as We The Band and Stationhead, the new label-based initiative looks to have more buy-in from artists and safer guardrails in case issues arise more quickly.\n\nStan Culture Doesn't Define The Fans\n\nRight now, stan culture is out of control and doesn't look even remotely redeemable. Since the hit song \"Stan,\" music listeners and the general public have used the term \"stan\" to identify obsessive fans with the potential for violence. Years after the song \"Stan\" came out, the internet helped unite stans quickly and easily, leveraging their skill sets and putting their abilities to efficient use. Lastly, when the record labels entered the conversation to make music sales and artist engagement more fan-centric, they opened the door for more vapid stans that directly impacted the artists, their music, and sometimes their personal lives.\n\nDespite the challenges this new era of stan culture presents, I found five solutions that will require record labels, streaming companies, social media platforms, and fans to implement to help turn this ship in a safer and more positive direction.\n\nThe five solutions were as follows:\n\nRecommendation #1: Spotlight The Behavior You Want To See Through Your Community Guidelines\n\nRecommendation #2: Focus On Building Positive Community Strategies Over Parasocial Relationships With the Artist\n\nRecommendation #3: Use Fans Love To Amplify Fundraising Initiatives Started By The Artist\n\nRecommendation #4: Uplift The Brand Identity Of Online Fan Communities Through Regular Meet-ups About The Music, Not The Artist.\n\nRecommendation #5: The Label Should Reward Positive Fan Bases With Exclusive Content and Opportunities For Their Healthy Behavior\n\nFortunately, many great and nurturing fan communities are helping people find their tribe and feel like they are part of a family because, in the most important ways, they are. Stan culture starts from a place of longing and love. Suppose we, as a music community, use the above strategies. In that case, we can help mobilize those feelings into enriching realities that allow artists to interact with the fans over the music in celebratory and healthy music.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please feel free to subscribe to my page for email notifications each time I upload a new piece! 🎧 You will also receive exclusive content through my official newsletter If Ever You're Listening. 🎵\n\nWant more marketing tips and tricks?
